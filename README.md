Second assignment of the Odin Project. Here we were given a design and some information (font, colors etc.). Flexbox practice is essential here as its one of the main features in CSS.

I used some other CSS features I saw on other courses and videos around the internet.
I don't know about the legality of my website because I used pictures and links from Sony.
